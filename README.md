 • DNA transcription 
 • Translation 
 • Secondary structure prediction 
 • ORF finder 
 • Regular expressions 
 • Formatting files from databases 
 • Other codes: toss a coin
• Helpful for life science students who have no prior experience with programming language and scripts #codes developed by JSS M.Sc. Bioinformatics students
